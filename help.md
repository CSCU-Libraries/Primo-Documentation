# CSCU Primo Documentation Hub Help Center

Put how to use Jekyll w/JustTheDocs theme and markdown here.

## Editing the Documentation website

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/Primo-Documentation/edit/gh-pages/index.md){:target="_blank"} to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Alternatively, you can use a regular git & markdown code-based workflow with pull requests in order to make changes. The branch for the website's code is the gh-pages branch (not the main branch), so keep that in mind.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/Primo-Documentation/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

#### Note:

_Added Kramdown links to config.yml per Stack Overflow answer to question about adding a link to launch in new tab (in html target="_blank") - SBC_
