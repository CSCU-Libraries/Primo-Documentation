# Welcome to the CSCU Primo Documentation Hub

This site is built on GitHub pages. Its goal is to provide a web front-end for both documentation and code (as needed) for CSCU libraries seeking to customize their implementation of Primo. CSCU is a library consortium that currently uses the Primo UI (formerly known as the NUI or New UI) / Primo Back Office. We do not currently use Primo VE. This documentation was compiled by the CSCU Primo Expert Team.

## Visiting the Documentation Website

The styled "front-end" of the documentation website can be seen at [https://cscu-libraries.github.io/PrimoDocumentation/](https://cscu-libraries.github.io/PrimoDocumentation/){:target="_blank"}.

## Editing the Documentation website

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/Primo-Documentation/edit/gh-pages/index.md){:target="_blank"} to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Alternatively, you can use a regular git & markdown code-based workflow with pull requests in order to make changes. The branch for the website's code is the gh-pages branch (not the main branch), so keep that in mind.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/Primo-Documentation/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

#### Note:

_Added Kramdown links to config.yml per Stack Overflow answer to question about adding a link to launch in new tab (in html target="_blank") - SBC_
