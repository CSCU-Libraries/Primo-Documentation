# Welcome to the CSCU Primo Documentation Hub

This site is built on GitHub pages. Its goal is to provide a web front-end for both documentation and code (as needed) for CSCU libraries seeking to customize their implementation of Primo. CSCU is a library consortium that currently uses the Primo UI (formerly known as the NUI or New UI) / Primo Back Office. We do not currently use Primo VE. This documentation was compiled by the CSCU Primo Expert Team.

## The Primo Customization Documentation Website

The styled "front-end" of the documentation website can be seen at [https://cscu-libraries.github.io/PrimoDocumentation/](https://cscu-libraries.github.io/PrimoDocumentation/){:target="_blank"}.
Information on the documentation repository (main branch) & for the documentation website (gh-pages branch) can be found at: https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/PrimoDocumentation
