README.md

This is the README for the documentation website visible at: https://cscu-libraries.github.io/PrimoDocumentation/ 

This work is being undertaken in the Summer of 2022, to establish the initial repository of documentation, links, and code that supports the documentation for the customization of Primo within the CSCU Library Consortium.

See our project planning for the repository at: https://github.com/orgs/CSCU-Libraries/projects/1

A related usability study that foregrounded this work is available at: https://github.com/sclappccsu/PrimoUX
