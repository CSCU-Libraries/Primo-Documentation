README.md

This is the README for the documentation website visible at: https://cscu-libraries.github.io/PrimoDocumentation/ based on the github repository visible at https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/PrimoDocumentation

We will be using the Github Pages (Jekyll pages) setup with a Just the Docs theme (see: https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/ from https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs). <br><em>Note: if there is a GH page  version of a repository whose url is https://github.com/githubusername/repositoryname it will be published at https://githubusername.github.io/repositoryname</em>

This work is being undertaken in Fall 2022, to establish the initial repository of documentation, links, and code that supports the documentation for the customization of Primo within the CSCU Library Consortium.


See our project planning for the repository at: https://github.com/orgs/CSCU-Libraries/projects/1
