README.md

This is the README for the documentation website visible at: https://cscu-libraries.github.io/PrimoDocumentation/ based on the github repository visible at https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/PrimoDocumentation <em><strong>with the content for the actual site visible on its gh-pages branch, visible at https://github.com/CSCU-Libraries/PrimoDocumentation/tree/gh-pages</strong></em>.

We will be using the Github Pages (Jekyll pages) setup with a Just the Docs theme (see: https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/ from https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs). <br><em>Note: if there is a GH page  version of a repository whose url is https://github.com/githubusername/repositoryname it will be published at https://githubusername.github.io/repositoryname</em>

* This work is being undertaken in Fall 2022, to establish an authoritative, easily publicly accessible repository of documentation, links, and code that supports the the customization of Primo within the CSCU Library Consortium.
* See our project planning for the repository at: https://github.com/orgs/CSCU-Libraries/projects/1
* This work is based on a survey conducted and compiled by Primo Team members in Spring 2021 on customizations that have been done by various libraries see: https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Lrsor4aIVC7Te0AX-X4/s/-LrsoT-JZyg4ggADtwdB/ and a presentation on it at: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cjYZOXpyDS1yOEcMYpHPgFYkEfEvTzWmcv_2xZ2F6Xk/edit?usp=sharing
* Some Primo customization documentation is currently visible (& probably in need of testing/updating?) at https://3.basecamp.com/3225494/buckets/2718410/vaults/402032753
** A usability study that foregrounded this work (sometimes led to Primo customizations via Primo Back Office) is available at: https://github.com/sclappccsu/PrimoUX, (compiled work of CSCU Primo team members Christine Dicarro, Angela Walker, Sharon Clapp based on survey to CSCU libraries). The "website" for this study is visible at https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Lrsor4aIVC7Te0AX-X4/s/-LrsoT-JZyg4ggADtwdB/.
